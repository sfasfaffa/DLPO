<H1>DLPO: Towards a Robust, Efficient, and Generalizable Prompt Optimization Framework from a Deep-Learning Perspective</H1>

Existing prompt optimization frameworks still face critical challenges in robustness, efficiency, and generalization.
To systematically address these challenges, we first conduct an empirical analysis to identify the limitations of current reflection-based prompt optimization paradigm.
Building on these insights, we propose 7 innovative approaches inspired by traditional deep learning paradigms for prompt optimization **DLPO**, seamlessly integrating these concepts into text-based gradient optimization. 
Through these advancements, we progressively tackle the aforementioned challenges and validate our methods through extensive experimentation.
We hope our study not only provides valuable guidance for future research but also offers a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and potential solutions in prompt optimization.
